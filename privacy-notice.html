## **3\. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?**

***In Short: I** only process your personal information when I believe it is necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill my contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill my legitimate business interests.*

***If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.***

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require me to explain the valid legal bases I rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, I may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

* **Consent. I** may process your information if you have given me permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about [withdrawing your consent](https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/85ebc085-8900-4e17-968d-cbb02f23ee53/privacy-policy#withdrawconsent).  
* **Performance of a Contract.** I may process your personal information when I believe it is necessary to fulfill my contractual obligations to you, including providing my Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.  
* **Legitimate Interests.** I may process your information when I believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve my legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, I may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:  
* Analyze how my Services are used so I can improve them to engage and retain users  
* Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities  
* **Legal Obligations.** I may process your information where I believe it is necessary for compliance with my legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend my legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which I are involved.  
* **Vital Interests.** I may process your information where I believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

***If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.***

I may process your information if you have given me specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can [withdraw your consent](https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/85ebc085-8900-4e17-968d-cbb02f23ee53/privacy-policy#withdrawconsent) at any time.

In some exceptional cases, I may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

* If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way  
* For investigations and fraud detection and prevention  
* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met  
* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim  
* For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin  
* If I have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse  
* If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province  
* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records  
* If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced  
* If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes

## **5\. DO I USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?**

***In Short:** I may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.*

I may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with my Services. Some online tracking technologies help me maintain the security of my Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.

I also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on my Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on my Services or on other websites.

To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "[DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?](https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/85ebc085-8900-4e17-968d-cbb02f23ee53/privacy-policy#uslaws)"

Specific information about how I use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in my Cookie Notice.

## **6\. DO I OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?**

***In Short:** I offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.*

As part of my Services, I offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, "AI Products"). These tools are designed to enhance your experience and provide you with innovative solutions. The terms in this Privacy Notice govern your use of the AI Products within my Services.

**Use of AI Technologies**

I provide the AI Products through third-party service providers ("AI Service Providers"), including OpenAI. As outlined in this Privacy Notice, your input, output, and personal information will be shared with and processed by these AI Service Providers to enable your use of my AI Products for purposes outlined in "[WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?](https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/85ebc085-8900-4e17-968d-cbb02f23ee53/privacy-policy#legalbases)" You must not use the AI Products in any way that violates the terms or policies of any AI Service Provider.

* No user personal information is processed by my AI services. Opt-out is not necessary.

## **7\. HOW LONG DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?**

***In Short: I** keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.*

I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require me keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, I will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then I will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## **8\. HOW DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**

***In Short: I** aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.*

I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I process. However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although I will do my best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from my Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## **9\. DO I COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?**

***In Short:** I do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.*

I do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do I knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If I learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, I will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from my records. If you become aware of any data I may have collected from children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, please contact me at lhrh.privat@gmail.com.

## **10\. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

***In Short:** Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.*

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, I will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/85ebc085-8900-4e17-968d-cbb02f23ee53/privacy-policy#contact)" below.

I will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  
   
If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe I are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your [Member State data protection authority](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm) or [UK data protection authority](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/).

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

**Withdrawing your consent:** If I are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/85ebc085-8900-4e17-968d-cbb02f23ee53/privacy-policy#contact)" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

### **Account Information**

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:

* Log in to your account settings and update your user account.

Upon your request to terminate your account, I will deactivate or delete your account and information from my active databases. However, I may retain some information in my files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce my legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of my Services.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email me at lhrh.privat@gmail.com.

## **11\. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, I do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that I must follow in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires me to let you know how I respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, I do not respond to them at this time.

## **12\. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

* **Right to access** your personal data  
* **Right to correct** inaccuracies in your personal data  
* **Right to request** the deletion of your personal data  
* **Right to obtain a copy** of the personal data you previously shared with us  
* **Right to non-discrimination** for exercising your rights

### **Request Verification**

Upon receiving your request, I will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom I have the information in my system. I will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if I cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, I may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.

If you submit the request through an authorized agent, I may need to collect additional information to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
