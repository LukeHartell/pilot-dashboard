            You can request a copy of all personal information stored in Pilot
            Dashboard. This includes profile details, your planes, flights, and
            any logbook entries. The report will be generated and sent to your
            registered email address.
          </p>

            For security reasons, passwords are never includedâ€”they are stored
            only as secure hashes, which are not shared. Files such as documents
            or photos may be encoded; you will need to decode them to view the
            original content.
