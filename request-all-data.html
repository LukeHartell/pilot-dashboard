            <p>
              You can request a copy of all personal information stored in Pilot Dashboard. 
              This includes your account details, any planes you've added, your flights, and 
              all logbook entries. Once you request your data, a report will be generated and 
              sent to your registered email address. The process may take a few minutes depending 
              on how much data you have.
            </p>

            <p>
              Passwords are not included in the export. They are stored as salted SHA-256 hashes, 
              and even these hashes are left out for security reasons. This helps keep your account 
              safe and prevents exposure of details about how passwords are protected.
