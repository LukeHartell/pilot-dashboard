        <p>
            Pilot Dashboard is a free, open-source web app designed to help
            pilots plan, log, and analyze their flights. It is built with a focus
            on simplicity, usability, and data privacy.

          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>
            A world where every pilot - glider, powered, or ultralight - can
            confidently plan, fly, and log their journeys using one userfriendly
            platform that works with them, not against them.

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>
            To empower pilots with a seamless, modern platform that simplifies
            every step of flying - before, during, and after - through trusted
            tools, intelligent insights, and total data ownership.
